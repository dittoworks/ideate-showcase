      <description>Bridget is a minimal Hugo theme designed for photographers/visual artists, powered by Solid.js.&#xA;The inspiration for this theme came from a video by Hyperlexed, which can be found here. Initially, it was developed using no third-party dependencies. However, after website designer Tyler McRobert made the source code publicly available, I realized that I have invented many unnecessary wheels, and this project was modified to porting the original design to Hugo while focusing on performance.</description>
